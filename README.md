## ðŸš€ Sobre o desafio

In this challenge, I created an application to train what I have learned so far at React Native!

This application lists my portfolio repositories, which I already developed the backend in the [last challenge using Node.js](https://github.com/marcelohs93/Challenge-01-Node)


### ðŸ’» Application features

- **`List repositories from API`**: Create a list of all the repositories that are registered in the API with the fields ** title **, ** techs ** and number of likes following the pattern `$ {repository.likes} likes`, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **`Like a listed API repository`**: Like an item in the API through a button with the text ** Like ** and update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile.

### ðŸ”Ž Test specification


- **`should add a like to the like counter of the repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow, by clicking on the 'Like' button, a like is added to the listed repository, and that this update can be viewed on the screen.
